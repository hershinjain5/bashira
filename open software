How to contribute to open source projects
When we speak about free software, we can't avoid talking about GitHub and related tools. Let's see what GitHub is and how it helps you to participate in open source projects.
Type of project
After you've chosen the language you want to work in, you need to choose the type of project you prefer. GitHub projects are categorized into folders called Showcases. Here are some examples of Showcases: "security", "virtual reality", "text editors", and "CSS preprocessors." Just choose a topic that interests you.

However, we do recommend paying extra attention to those projects that would be used by broad spectrum of people so you'll have the chance to test your code on a large real-world audience. For example, the "Emoji" Showcase contains 25 repositories that represent its popularity. Another tip on how to choose an OSS project is to start working on software you already use or software you're interested in using. This will keep you motivated to keep on working.
